Hi there! I'm Koen, and I started my PhD in the Machine Learning for Physical Sciences group in October 2021. I like to work on a broad range of topics and problems and with people from all kinds of backgrounds. My PhD research has focused on developing generative machine learning models that can simulate stochastic systems, with applications in physics and biology.
